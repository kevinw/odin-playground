### TODO

- Get frustum corners from "camera" and use interpolatedRay from my own gist to calculate screen rays https://gist.github.com/kevinw/80593a34b7211d99d251d266e957fe87
- Try odin's Oculus bindings
- Read through and grok [odin-gl_examples](https://github.com/vassvik/odin-gl_examples)
- Try Looking Glass instanced rendering, and [screen space reprojection for raymarching](https://github.com/HamtaroDeluxe/RMVR)
- Load models with [cgltf](https://github.com/jkuhlmann/cgltf) or something similar
- Figure out [reversed-Z](https://nlguillemot.wordpress.com/2016/12/07/reversed-z-in-opengl/) for terrain rendering accuracy
- Grok "Advanced Scenegraph Rendering Pipeline" http://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2013/presentations/S3032-Advanced-Scenegraph-Rendering-Pipeline.pdf
