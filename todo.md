### TODO

- Get frustum corners from "camera" and use `interpolatedRay` from my own [gist to calculate screen rays](https://gist.github.com/kevinw/80593a34b7211d99d251d266e957fe87)
- Try odin's Oculus bindings
- Play sounds with [mini_al](https://github.com/dr-soft/mini_al)
- Read through and grok [odin-gl_examples](https://github.com/vassvik/odin-gl_examples)
- Try Looking Glass instanced rendering, and [screen space reprojection for raymarching](https://github.com/HamtaroDeluxe/RMVR)
- Load models with [cgltf](https://github.com/jkuhlmann/cgltf) or something similar
- Figure out [reversed-Z](https://nlguillemot.wordpress.com/2016/12/07/reversed-z-in-opengl/) for terrain rendering accuracy
- Grok "Advanced Scenegraph Rendering Pipeline" http://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2013/presentations/S3032-Advanced-Scenegraph-Rendering-Pipeline.pdf
- try building something like [render graphs](http://themaister.net/blog/2017/08/15/render-graphs-and-vulkan-a-deep-dive/) (or see [here](https://ourmachinery.com/post/high-level-rendering-using-render-graphs/))
